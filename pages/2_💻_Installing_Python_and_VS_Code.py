## Installing Anaconda
        
We recommend Anaconda since it simplifies the installation and setup of Python significantly and comes with a set of tools you can
continue to use to an advanced level of proficiency with Python.
            
By installing Anaconda you get:
- **Python**: A recent and stable version of the core Python programming language.
- **VS Code**: One of the best and the most popular tools to write code (not only in Python but most langauges). It has many features that make it a fantastic option for Data Science.
- **Conda**: A package managing tool. With conda you can manage different Python environments and install different versions of Python with ease.
- **Data Science Libraries**: The most popular libraries to work with data are preinstalled.

### Installing Anaconda

Depending on whether your Mac has an M1/M2 or Intel processor, you will have to download a different version of miniconda and VS Code. Check the processor 
type by clicking on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen and selecting About this Mac. 

If you have an M1/M2 processor, you will see Apple M1 in the Overview tab. If you have an Intel processor, you will see Intel in the Overview tab.
